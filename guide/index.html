Then you will be given a date for the driving test. After successful completion of the three tests you will be issued your new Japanese driver’s license.<br><br>
However Japan Automobile federation (JAF) has divided the countries into two categories where each has to follow different procedures when it comes to the tests.<br><br>
If your foreign  driver’s license is from one of the following countries You are not required to take the written or practical test to convert your foreign license to japanese license, you only has to pass the eye test and you will receive your new license on the same day.

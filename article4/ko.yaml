sub1Cont: In this section, we will talk about what you should be careful with using the auction agent. There are mainly 7 points you should be careful with using the auction agent. 
li1: Exhibition form and evaluation points are not an absolute thing
cont1_1: At the used vehicle auction, exhibition form will be given to each vehicle. Exhibition form is a form which the inspector of the auction house fills in the vehicle condition. Since the inspector at the auction house is a third party for both seller and the buyer, the exhibition form they fill in is basically trustworthy.
cont1_2: However, the inspector of the auction house does not always fill in the exhibition form correctly, there could be human error. At the huge scale auction houses, they need to check tons of vehicles within a limited time (The time they can spend for 1 vehicle is about 15 minutes), and there is a possibility where they could miss a defect as a matter of course.
cont1_3: Also, the exhibition form will only indicate basic information such as the vehicle name, mileage, inspection date, and does not indicate whether the engine oil was exchanged properly, or whether the smell in the vehicle is unpleasant or not. You should keep in mind that what’s indicated on exhibition form is only a small portion of the vehicle information.
cont1_4: Also the evaluation points indicated on the exhibition form is only an evaluation of the merchandise value such as interior, exterior, mileage, etc., and does not cover the popularity of the vehicle type itself at the market. Sometimes, there are cases where the price becomes high even the evaluation point is low, or the price gets low even the evaluation point is high. Evaluation point is an important factor, however, it would be better to not rely on it too much.
li2: The buyer may not conduct a pre-inspection him/herself.
cont2_1: The only person who can enter the used vehicle auction house is the agent who has been approved to enter the auction house. People may not enter the auction house. Instead, the employee of the auction agent, or the pre-inspection agent who has received a request from the auction agent, will conduct an inspection.
cont2_2: This pre-inspection does not have the time limit, however, since it is not allowed to have a test ride, you should be careful when buying exceeded mileage vehicle or an old type vehicle.
cont2_3: However, it is rare that trouble will occur after buying the vehicle, so worrying too much is not that good. If the mileage is below 50,000km, it should be fine, and it is even fine exceeding 150,000km depending on the situation. These parts are hard to understand unless you are a professional, so it would be better for the inspection agent to check.
li3: Successful bid may not be made for sure
cont3: Since there are rivals at the auction, you cannot always make a successful bid the way you want. Depending on the agent, there are some cases where they ask for the auction agent commission just by bidding.
li4: The price is not determined
cont4_1: What’s different from buying at the used vehicle shop, is that the successful bid price will not be determined until the moment the auction ends at the used vehicle auction. It is possible to know the approximate market price from the auction agent before the auction, but there is no guarantee that the auction will proceed the way the auction agent has predicted.
cont4_2: You should keep in mind that there is a possibility that you can purchase the vehicle with cheap price, but also have a possibility that the price becomes higher unexpectedly.
li5: Cancellation cannot be made after making a successful bid
cont5_1: You cannot cancel the successful bid after it is made.
cont5_2: Even the quality of the vehicle you purchased was worse than you thought, it is still impossible to cancel.
cont5_3: In case you happen to become out of contact, there is a possibility that you will be charged for the penalty fee due to the nonfulfillment of the contract, so you must stay in contact.
li6: Claim after purchasing is basically not accepted
cont6_1: At the used vehicle auction, basically “no claim, no return” is a general rule.
cont6_2: Claim term is prescribed at the auction houses, and you may claim to the auction house during the claim term, however, this claim term is generally about a week which is extremely short, and since the claim range is limited, you cannot use it actively.
cont6_3: For example, there are quite a few auction houses where they do not cover the defects under several million yen.
cont6_4: Basically you should keep in mind that “no claim, no return” is a general rule at the used vehicle auction.
li7: There are no guarantee in many cases
cont7_1: At the used vehicle auction, in order to keep the agent commission cheap, all the maintenance fee etc., after purchasing is borne by the buyer as a general rule. There are cases depending on the agent, where they have guarantee separately, however you will be charged for it in most cases.
cont7_2: As we mentioned above, “no claim, no return” is a general rule. If you find it difficult to find problems one thing another after purchasing it would be better to look for a different purchase method.
cont7_3: It seems like there are many things to be careful with, however there are so many advantages as well at the used vehicle auction.
cont7_4: The fact that you have high possibility of purchasing the vehicle with cheap price is the biggest advantages. If you think you want the purchase with a few risk, please make a challenge of participating in the used vehicle auction. If you find a good agent, I believe you will be able to find your ideal vehicle.
